                <p>“When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all of
                    your thoughts break their bonds. Your mind transcends limitations; your
                    consciousness expands in every direction; and you find yourself in a new, great
                    and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive and you
                    discover yourself to be a greater person than you ever dreamed yourself to be.”

                        </header>
                        <p>Counselling is an incredibly powerful tool that helps tackle a wide range
                            of issues such as depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem issues, anger
                            issues. Counselling is an incredibly powerful tool that helps tackle a
                            wide range of issues such as depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem
                            issues, anger issues, inter personal/ relationship issues,
                            self-improvement and career growth., inter personal/ relationship
                            issues, self-improvement and career growth. It is a professional
                            relationship between a trained counsellor and a client wherein the
                            former offers a safe, confidential and non-judgmental space for the
                            latter to work towards gaining insights and solutions to his/her
                            problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is an intense process that places importance on the quality of
                            therapeutic relationship between the client and the counsellor, to be
                            built on empathic understanding, respect, genuineness, non-judgmental
                            atmosphere and positive regard.

                        </header>
                        <p>A Counsellor is an empathetic listener. During the sessions, the
                            counsellor creates a safe space for the client and utilizes the
                            knowledge of her theoretical orientation and various counselling tools
                            and techniques. The client and the counsellor understand the problem
                            better to collaboratively set goals for therapy. The client then
                            explores, evaluates, clarifies and understands his/ her patterns of
                            thoughts, feelings and behaviors and uses these insights and in-built
                            strengths to make the desired change. In all cases, counselling should
                            result in free and responsible behavior on the part of the client,
                            accompanied by more insight into him or herself and ability to
                            understand and better manage negative emotions. The tools and techniques
                            offered by the counsellor are also utilized by the client for the same.

            <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt=""/></a>

            <p>I have more than 25 years’ experience in family counselling. Among that I have worked
                with Family Court, Ernakulam, Peoples Counselling for Social Justice, Ernakulam and
                Juvenile Justice Board, Ernakulam and Child Welfare Committee Ernakulam. I have wide
                experience in handling family issues, behavioral problems, adolescent issues and
                role of effective parenting etc.</p>

            <p>It is necessary that people have a safe and non-judgmental space to talk about
                difficult and unpleasant aspects of their lives. It is important to encourage
                awkward conversations that are otherwise constrained by fear. It is essential that
                people understand their own inner world, motivations, thoughts, feelings and actions
                without any judgement. It is important that people feel seen and heard, and quoting
                famous Psychologist Carl Rogers, I truly believe "people only seriously consider
                change when they feel accepted for exactly who they are". And I aim to hold such a
                space for my clients to help them see themselves as a whole (including the broken,
                unpleasant, neglected parts of self), fully accept themselves, and to heal.</p>
