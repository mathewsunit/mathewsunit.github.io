    “Journey with You”
    
            Our Vision

When you are inspired by some great purpose,
 some extra ordinary project
 all of your thoughts break their bonds
Your mind transcends limitations
 your consciousness expands in every direction
you find yourself in new and great and wonderful world
 Dormant forces, faculties and talents come alive, and you discover your self 
to be a greater person by far than you ever dreamed yourself to be

                            Patanjali

About Me

Sheela Mariyam Oommen (Sheela Baji), Family Counselling Therapist    
Iam a Qualified Family Counselling Therapist based in Kochi, India have                (Photo)
more than 25 years’ experience in family counselling. Among that I have worked with Family Court, Ernakulam, Peoples Counselling for Social Justice, Ernakulam and Juvenile Justice Board, Ernakulam and Child Welfare Committee Ernakulam. I have wide experience in handling family issues, behavioral problems, adolescent issues and role of effective parenting etc. 

 It is necessary that people have a safe and non-judgmental space to talk about difficult and unpleasant aspects of their lives. It is important to encourage awkward conversations that are otherwise constrained by fear. It is essential that people understand their own inner world, motivations, thoughts, feelings and actions without any judgement. It is important that people feel seen and heard, and quoting famous Psychologist Carl Rogers, I truly believe "people only seriously consider change when they feel accepted for exactly who they are". And I aim to hold such a space for my clients to help them see themselves as a whole (including the broken, unpleasant, neglected parts of self), fully accept themselves, and to heal.

“COUNSILLOR IS A EMPATHATIC LISTNER”



What is Counselling
Counselling is a professional relationship between a trained counsellor and a client wherein the former offers a safe, confidential and non-judgmental space for the latter to work towards gaining insights and solutions to his/her problems.



It is an intense process that places importance on the quality of therapeutic relationship between the client and the counsellor, to be built on empathic understanding, respect, genuineness, non-judgmental atmosphere and positive regard. 



During the sessions, the counsellor creates a safe space for the client and utilizes the knowledge of her theoretical orientation and various counselling tools and techniques. The client and the counsellor understand the problem better to collaboratively set goals for therapy. The client then explores, evaluates, clarifies and understands his/ her patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviors and uses these insights and in-built strengths to make the desired change. In all cases, counselling should result in free and responsible behavior on the part of the client, accompanied by more insight into him or herself and ability to understand and better manage negative emotions. The tools and techniques offered by the counsellor are also utilized by the client for the same. 

When to Seek Counselling
