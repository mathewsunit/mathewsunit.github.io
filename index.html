                <p>“When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all of
                    your thoughts break their bonds. Your mind transcends limitations; your
                    consciousness expands in every direction; and you find yourself in a new, great
                    and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive and you
                    discover yourself to be a greater person than you ever dreamed yourself to be.”

            <p>We at <i>“Oppam”(ഒപ്പം)</i>, meaning Togetherness or Support, focus on building a
                confidential and non-judgmental space for clients to explore, evaluate and
                understand their inner world, belief systems and problems.</p>
            <p>We believe this will help them gain self-awareness and produce meaningful
                construction of the past (and present) events so that they can learn to accept
                themselves as a whole and make the desired changes to truly enrich their lives.
            </p>
            <p>It is our right to discover the inner world of thoughts and feelings and
                the power of light, hope, love and beauty.
            </p>

                        </header>
                        <p>Counselling is a tool that helps us tackle a wide range of issues such as
                            depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem issues, anger issues,
                            interpersonal/relationship issues, self-improvement and career growth.
                            It is built on a professional therapeutic relationship between a trained
                            counsellor and a client wherein the former offers a safe, confidential
                            and non-judgmental space for the latter to work towards gaining insights
                            and solutions to his/her problems.

                        </header>
                        When one needs to deal with an immediate psychological/ emotional
                        problem.<br/>
                        When one needs to explore their inner world for emotional growth.<br/>
                        When capacities responding to demands of life are strained.<br/>
                        When natural support systems are not available.<br/>
                        Counselling is not giving advice or guidance.<br/>
                        Counselling is not offering instant solutions to problems.<br/>
                        Counselling is not being judgmental.<br/>
                        Counselling is not 'Just talking'.<br/>
                        Counselling is not imposing counsellor’s values, morals and beliefs on the
                        client.<br/>
                        Counselling is not the answer to all human difficulties.<br/>

                            <h3>Who is a Counsellor?</h3>
                        </header>
                        <p>A Counsellor is an empathetic listener. During sessions, the
                            counsellor creates a safe space for the client and utilizes the
                            knowledge of her theoretical orientation and counselling tools.
                            The client and the counsellor understand the problem
                            better to collaboratively set goals for therapy. The client then
                            explores, evaluates, clarifies and understands their patterns of
                            thoughts, feelings and behaviors and uses these insights and their own
                            strengths to make the desired change. In all cases, counselling should
                            result in free and responsible behavior on the part of the client,
                            accompanied by more insight into themselves and the ability to
                            understand and manage negative emotions.

            <p>My name is Sheela Mariyam Oommen (Sheela Baji). I have more than 25 years’ experience
                in family counselling. I have worked with the Family Court, Ernakulam,
                Peoples Counselling for Social Justice, Ernakulam, Juvenile Justice Board, Ernakulam
                and Child Welfare Committee Ernakulam. I have wide
                experience in handling family issues, behavioral problems, adolescent issues and
                role of effective parenting etc.</p>

            <p>It is necessary that people have a safe and non-judgmental space to talk about
                difficult and unpleasant aspects of their lives. It is important to encourage
                awkward conversations that are otherwise constrained by fear. It is essential that
                people understand their own inner world, motivations, thoughts, feelings and actions
                without any judgement. It is important that people feel seen and heard, and quoting
                famous Psychologist Carl Rogers, I truly believe "people only seriously consider
                change when they feel accepted for exactly who they are". And I aim to hold such a
                space for my clients to help them see themselves as a whole (including the broken,
                unpleasant, neglected parts of self), fully accept themselves, and to heal.</p>
